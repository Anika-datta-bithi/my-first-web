            <h2>The role of dairy in healthy and sustainable food</h2>
            <p>It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and
                cancer.
                Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced
                trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.
                A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods.</p>

                <p>Eating good food, especially with family and friends, is one of the pleasures of life.We all know
                    that people who eat healthy, balanced diets are likely to have:

                    plenty of energy to work and enjoy themselves;

                    fewer infections and other illnesses.</p>

                <p>. Everyone uses salt in cooking and there is salt in many processed foods. Too much salt is harmful
                    and can lead to high blood pressure. Iodized salt is an important source of iodine. Herbs, spices,
                    garlic and onions are examples of other flavouring foods that help to make meals tasty.</p>
